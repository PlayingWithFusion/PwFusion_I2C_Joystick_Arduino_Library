* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains firmware to flash an AtTiny841-MMHR included in
* the Playing with Fusion I2C joystick interface board (IFB-40002).
* Funcionality is as described below:
*   - Read values from joystick componet
*   - Pack values into a register struct
*   - Send values over the i2c bus when requested
